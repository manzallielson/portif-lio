    "text": "Graduated in Digital Games from FATEC Americana, I have been working as a Front-End Developer since 2021, with a main focus on creating efficient, performant, and scalable interfaces using React.js and TypeScript. I work on both complex applications and agile solutions, integrating routines and automations through n8n and developing features on low-code platforms like Bubble, which accelerates deliveries and increases team productivity. On a daily basis, I use tools like Postman and DBeaver to support tests and queries when necessary, and I have had occasional contact with AWS CloudWatch to monitor metrics and logs as a complement. My experience combines modern front-end development with automation practices and building complete digital products."
